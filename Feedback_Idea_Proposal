Thank you for the detailed and well-researched proposal — addressing air pollution through predictive analytics is a highly relevant and socially impactful goal that aligns strongly with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). Your plan to integrate both meteorological and pollutant data into a hybrid ML/DL forecasting system demonstrates strong technical insight. The inclusion of personalized user recommendations and early warning mechanisms is particularly valuable in bridging the gap between data science and public health action.

To further enhance the novelty and reach of your system, consider incorporating spatial prediction techniques such as geostatistical kriging or using satellite-derived pollution data (e.g., from NASA’s Sentinel or MODIS) to provide coverage in areas with limited ground sensors. Additionally, integrating mobile crowdsourced data (e.g., from low-cost IoT-based air quality sensors) could enrich your model and promote community involvement. You may also explore multi-output forecasting models that predict not just one but several pollutants at once — ideal for urban settings where multiple pollutants interact. Lastly, implementing a real-time visualization dashboard using tools like Plotly Dash or Streamlit could make your insights more accessible to non-technical users, policymakers, and community groups.
